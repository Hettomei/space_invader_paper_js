Another space_invaders
using javascript, and lib "paper.js"

This project needs a lot of refactoring.

And we can add a lot of optimisation.

It was created to learn javascript, and a "canvas" lib, like -why not- paper.js http://paperjs.org/

this need to be run using a local server - like

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or

```shell
ruby -rwebrick -e'WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 3000, :DocumentRoot => Dir.pwd).start'
```

or
```shell
$ echo "do_what_you_want_with_lamp_mamp_xamp_wamp_IIS_node.js...."
```
